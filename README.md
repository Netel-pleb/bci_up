This dataset features EEG recordings for Motor Imagery (MI) BCI from 52 participants, along with EMG data, EEG electrode locations, and questionnaire responses. Itâ€™s been validated to show key MI patterns (ERD/ERS), and 73% of the data has strong discriminative features. Great for digging into BCI performance variation and understanding what makes some sessions work better than others
